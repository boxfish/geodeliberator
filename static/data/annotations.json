One night around 11pm, he felt like to have a smoke, but he was not sure whether the campus was allowed for smoking. So he walked out from IST building to the nearby golf course (as I sketched on the map), and lid a <span class=\"mut_lvs\">cigarette</span>. When he was enjoying the smoking, suddenly a police showed up and questioned him why he was out there in the late night. He had to explain and the police told him it was not safe to hang out in the night and let him leave. My friend was scared and he complained that if the whole campus was smoke-free, where should they smoke, especially in the nights? <br>",
